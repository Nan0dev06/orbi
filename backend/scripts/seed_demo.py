"""Demo safety: seed every connected test calendar with realistic Beirut events.

Creates staggered events (with locations) over the next few days so the demo
shows real busy blocks being intersected — no dependence on live third-party
state. Each seeded event carries a private marker so re-seeding is clean:

    python backend/scripts/seed_demo.py          # wipe old demo events, seed fresh
    python backend/scripts/seed_demo.py --wipe   # remove demo events only

Only touches events THIS script created (never the account's own events).
