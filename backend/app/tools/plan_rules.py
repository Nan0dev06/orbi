"""The plan cascade — implemented exactly once, as pure functions.

Spec (decide-once, implement exactly):

STAGE 1 — INTEREST. Every group member is asked about the plan itself (place +
day), NOT about a time. "Sam suggested the usual coffee shop today, Monday 20
July. Coming?"
  no  -> they are OUT of the plan entirely. Never asked about any time.
  yes -> they join the interested cohort, and their yes IMMEDIATELY opens the
         time question for them. This is per-person: nobody waits for the rest
         of the group to answer stage 1 first.

STAGE 2 — TIME. Only the interested cohort is asked, and only about the ONE
time that is currently active (5 PM).
  no  -> out of THAT time only. They stay in the cohort, because if the host
         moves on to 7 PM they get asked again.

THE HOST DECIDES — there is no automatic threshold here. No majority rule, no
unanimity, no auto-booking, and no auto-rejection on a single no. These
functions only REPORT: ballot_for() says what one member should be answering
right now, tally() builds the summary box the host reads. The host then either
confirms the active time (booking only the people who said yes to it) or moves
to the next time, which re-asks the WHOLE interested cohort — including the
people who already said yes to 5 PM, since 7 PM is a different question.
State transitions live in plan_service.py; nothing here touches the DB.
