"""Live availability via Google Calendar's freebusy endpoint.

PRIVACY BY ARCHITECTURE: freebusy.query returns ONLY busy time ranges —
no titles, no descriptions, no attendees. Event contents never enter this
system. This module is the only place member availability is read.

We read every calendar the member OWNS or can EDIT (personal, uni, summer
semester, …) and union their busy blocks — being busy on ANY of them makes
the member busy. Read-only *subscribed* calendars (Holidays, a friend's
calendar) are skipped so they don't over-block the group's availability.
