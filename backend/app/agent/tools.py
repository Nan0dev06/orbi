"""Agent tools: JSON schemas the model sees + the Python that runs them.

The agent's full toolbox:
- get_group_members  — resolve the group and who has connected a calendar
- find_meeting_slots — live freebusy + intersection + reasonable-hours filter
- suggest_venues     — location-anchored REAL venue search
- create_plan        — put a plan (place + day + candidate times) to the group
- get_plan_status    — the host's decision box: who's in, out, and in/out on the time
- use_next_time      — host move: this time didn't work, ask the cohort the next one
- lock_in_time       — host move: commit the active time, booking its yes-voters

Each tool logs its invocation so the agent loop is visible in the server log
(the "show the judges the loop" requirement).
