"""Availability service — the bridge between the DB and the Phase 1 slot math.

Given a group, this fetches LIVE freebusy for every connected member (fresh at
call time, per the real-time requirement), then reuses app/tools/slots.py to
compute common free windows and a partial-availability breakdown for graceful
degradation when no window works for everyone.

Privacy: only busy time ranges are ever read (freebusy). No event titles.
Token refresh: if a member's OAuth token was refreshed during load, the new
token is written back to the DB immediately so it never silently goes stale.
