"""Plan endpoints: members answer their step of the cascade; Orbi creates plans.

GET  /groups/{group_id}/plans      -> plans for a group, each carrying THIS
                                      member's current ballot (and, for the
                                      host, the decision box)
POST /plans/{plan_id}/interest     {"yes": true}  -> stage 1 answer
POST /plans/{plan_id}/time-vote    {"yes": true, "round_id": 3} -> stage 2 answer

The cascade is visible in the responses: answering interest=yes comes straight
back with `ballot.stage == "time"` — that one yes opened the time question for
that member, without waiting on anybody else.

Note what is NOT here: no rule fires on a vote. Voting never books, never
rejects, never advances a time. Those are host moves and they go through the
agent (see agent/tools.py -> use_next_time / lock_in_time), which is what keeps
a human in the loop before anything reaches a calendar.
